previous wwe want to create and insert collection means syntax is
      db.employee.insertMany() or insertOne()
      
      
 we can also create like this     
      db.createCollection('user')
        { ok: 1 }
      db.user.find()  // till now we dont insert any value so it is empty
      db.user.insertOne({name:"venni"})
